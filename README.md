🖥️ Project Description 🖥️
This Machine Project was made in lieu of the course GDINFMG and serves as a culmination of what the students have learned about databases. 
The software is a game data repository for the game, Punishing Gray Raven, that helps users by providing a knowledge base of characters in the game, 
recommended and accessible teams for certain game modes and create mock-up teams that they can experiment with. 

The software has four buttons for four features:

Character - This button brings up a database of the characters in the game that are currently available up until the patch of the character Lamia.

Warzone - This button brings up a list of ideal elemental teams that need to be brought for this game mode.

Pain Cage - This button brings up a database of bosses that players can encounter. When selecting a boss, the recommended teams to use against them
            are displayed as well.

Create Team - This button allows users to mix and match different team compositions to help them out in the game.
